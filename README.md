⚡ PHP Micro Framework – Build-Your-Own MVC Routing System
Welcome to phpFrameworkLando, a lightweight, educational PHP micro-framework designed to teach and showcase the essentials of routing, HTTP request/response handling, and the MVC pattern — built entirely from scratch without heavy frameworks.

🚀 Highlights
✅ Clean, minimal MVC folder structure
✅ Fast, simple routing via FastRoute
✅ PSR-4 compatible autoloading setup
✅ Custom HTTP Request and Response classes
✅ Designed to be easily extendable (middleware, templating, etc.)
✅ Ready to use with PHP’s built-in server or Lando

🧠 How It Works
index.php serves as the front controller that starts the application.

The Request class pulls data from PHP superglobals.

Kernel matches incoming routes and dispatches to:

a closure, or

a controller method ([Controller::class, 'method'])

Response handles sending headers and content back to the client.

🖥️ Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phpFrameworkLando.git
cd phpFrameworkLando
2️⃣ Install dependencies:

nginx
Copy
Edit
composer install
3️⃣ Run the server:

Option A — Built-in PHP server

cpp
Copy
Edit
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
Option B — Using Lando

sql
Copy
Edit
lando start
Then open in your browser:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8000/posts/1
📦 Composer Autoloading
Verify PSR-4 autoload setup:

lua
Copy
Edit
composer dump-autoload
Defined namespaces follow PSR-4:

swift
Copy
Edit
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "app/",
        "Somecode\\Framework\\": "framework/"
    }
}
